# Frontend

This repo currently serves static HTML/CSS/JS from the repository root (see `index.html`).

We are introducing a `frontend/` + `backend/` structure for the migration, but **we are not moving the existing public site yet** to avoid breaking paths during the transition.

Next step (later): move the public site into `frontend/public/` and serve the authenticated app under `/app`.
